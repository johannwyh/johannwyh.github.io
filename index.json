To address this challenge, researchers have used pretrained StyleGAN image generators for high-quality frame synthesis and focused on motion generator design. The motion generator is trained in an autoregressive manner using heavy 3D convolutional discriminators to ensure motion coherence during video generation. In this paper, we introduce a novel motion generator design that uses a learning-based inversion network for GAN. The encoder in our method captures rich and smooth priors from encoding images to latents, and given the latent of an initially generated frame as guidance, our method can generate smooth future latent by modulating the inversion encoder temporally. Our method enjoys the advantage of sparse training and naturally constrains the generation space of our motion generator with the inversion network guided by the initial frame, eliminating the need for heavy discriminators. Moreover, our method supports style transfer with simple fine-tuning when the encoder is paired with a pretrained StyleGAN generator. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating long and high-resolution videos with decent single-frame quality and temporal consistency.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":" StyleInV: A Temporal Style Modulated Inversion Network for Unconditional Video Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuhan Wang"],"categories":["Notes"],"content":"Introduction Now we have a bilevel programming problem:\n$$\\min_{\\theta, w_{\\theta}} F(w_{\\theta},\\theta)\\mathrm{\\ such\\ that\\ } w_{\\theta}\\in \\arg \\min_{w} L(w, \\theta) \\tag{1}$$\nwhere for the inner problem, $w$ is learned by\n$$ w_{\\theta, T} = \\Phi(w_{\\theta, T-1}, \\theta) = \\Phi(\\Phi(w_{\\theta,T-2}, \\theta), \\theta) = \\cdots \\tag{2} $$\nAs is stated in the paper, we follow a process of $\\tau$ times inner, once outer. In such process we can directly compute the gradients of the outer params, as $\\theta$ in our problem.\nTherefore, our major concern now is to compute $\\nabla_{\\theta}F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)$, with which we can update $\\theta$ using Adam or SGD optimizer.\nDerivation We have inner param $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_w}$ and outer param $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_{\\theta}}$. $\\nabla_{\\theta}F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)$ can be written as\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} = F_w(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)\\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta, T} + F_{\\theta}(w_{\\theta,T},\\theta) \\tag{3} $$\nHere $F_w$ and $F_{\\theta}$ can both be easily computed using PyTorch, and $\\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta, T}$ builds the connection to inner updater $\\Phi$. As the inner param $w$ undergoes $\\tau$ times of update, we have to derive its recursive formula:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta,T} \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi(w_{\\theta,T-1}, \\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} \\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\Phi_w(w_{\\theta,T-1}, \\theta)\\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta,T-1}+\\Phi_{\\theta}(w_{\\theta,T-1},\\theta) \\\\\n\u0026amp;= D_{T-1} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta,T-1} + E_{T-1} \\end{aligned} \\tag{4} $$\nHere $D$ and $E$ denote the jacobian matrix of $\\Phi$ w.r.t $w$ and $\\theta$ respectively, who can be efficiently computed via Auto Grad. Therefore, $D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_w \\times N_w}$, $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_w \\times N_{\\theta}}$ and $\\nabla_{\\theta}w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_w \\times N_{\\theta}}$. The dimension of $(4)$ matches.\nIf we combine equation $(3)$ and $(4)$, we can derive the equation between $\\nabla_{\\theta}F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)$ and $\\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta,T-1}$. Then if we repeat the process of $(4)$ we can get the equation between $\\nabla_{\\theta}F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)$ and $\\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta,T-2}$, $\\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta,T-3}$, and so on. Therefore, as is done by LDS-GNN paper, we can try to derive the equation between $\\nabla_{\\theta}F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)$ and jacobian matrix $\\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta,t}$ of any round as,\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} = P_t \\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta, t} + G_t \\tag{5} $$\nFrom equation $(3)$ we know that $P_T = F_w(w_{\\theta,T},\\theta)$ and $G_T = F_{\\theta}(w_{\\theta,T}, \\theta)$, which are both easy to compute. And if equation $(5)$ holds for $t$, we can derive that for $t-1$ as\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} \u0026amp;= P_t \\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta, t} + G_t \\\\\n\u0026amp;= P_t \\cdot (D_{t-1} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta,t-1} + E_{t-1}) + G_t \\\\\n\u0026amp;= (P_t \\cdot D_{t-1}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta,t-1} + (P_t \\cdot E_{t-1} + G_t) \\\\\n\u0026amp;= P_{t-1} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta}w_{\\theta, t-1} + G_{t-1} \\end{aligned} \\tag{6} $$\nHence, $P_{t-1} = P_{t} \\cdot D_{t-1}$ and $G_{t-1} = P_{t} \\cdot E_{t-1} + G_{t}$.\nAll we need to do is keep deriving it until $t=T-\\tau$, where $\\nabla_{\\theta} w_{\\theta, T-\\tau} = \\mathbf{0}$ as $w_{\\theta, T-\\tau}$ has nothing to do with current $\\theta$.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} \u0026amp;= P_{T-\\tau} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta} w_{\\theta, T-\\tau} + G_{T-\\tau} \\\\\n\u0026amp;= P_{T-\\tau} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\theta} w_{\\theta, T-\\tau} + (P_{T-\\tau+1} \\cdot E_{T-\\tau} + G_{T-\\tau+1}) \\\\\n\u0026amp;= P_{T-\\tau+1} \\cdot E_{T-\\tau} + G_{T-\\tau+1} \\end{aligned} \\tag{7} $$\nFinally, Eq. $(7)$ gives the final formula of $\\nabla_{\\theta}F(w_{\\theta, T}, \\theta)$ in a recursion form.

Meanwhile, we introduce the Semantic Facial Fusion module to optimize the combination of encoder and decoder features and make adaptive blending, which makes the results more photo-realistic.

More recently, the idea of mining-based strategies is adopted to emphasize the misclassified samples, achieving promising results. However, during the entire training pro- cess, the prior methods either do not explicitly emphasize the sample based on its importance that renders the hard samples not fully exploited; or explicitly emphasize the ef- fects of semi-hard/hard samples even at the early training stage that may lead to convergence issue. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Curriculum Learning loss (Cur- ricularFace) that embeds the idea of curriculum learning into the loss function to achieve a novel training strategy for deep face recognition, which mainly addresses easy sam- ples in the early training stage and hard ones in the later stage. Specifically, our CurricularFace adaptively adjusts the relative importance of easy and hard samples during different training stages. In each stage, different samples are assigned with different importance according to their corresponding difficultness. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our CurricularFace over the state-of-the-art competitors.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":" CurricularFace: Adaptive Curriculum Learning Loss for Deep Face Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
